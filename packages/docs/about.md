## Colophon

Wiktapi would not exist without:

- [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) — the collaboratively edited dictionary that is the ultimate source of all data.
- [kaikki.org](https://kaikki.org/) — pre-processes the raw Wiktionary dumps into structured JSONL, making the data practical to consume.
